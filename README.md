# cat-deterrent
## Intro
Cats are beloved by many, but even the the most en-
dured cat enjoyer can have quandaries with their pet.
They do whatever they want as Ernest Hemingway said
in For Whom the Bell Tolls, “No animal has more liberty
than the cat, but it buries the mess it makes. The cat
is the best anarchist.” However, with some peoples’ pets,
they do not bury their mess. In fact, they can create a lot
of mess for there owners. Cats can cause issues for their
owners in a multitude of ways. The cat catastrophes that
will be focused on here are cats that jump to places they
are not welcome such as counter tops , hot electric stoves,
and harassing other tanked animals. Stopping cats be-
ing in these undesirably places is the problem that this
project aims to solve. The plan is to construct a mo-
tion tracking water gun turret to deter them from their
mischievous meandering.
The system proposed in to accomplish our goals will be
detecting motion, tracking it, and aiming a water gun to
hit its target. The final system will be battery operated
so that it is independent of a computer interface and
bench power supply.
